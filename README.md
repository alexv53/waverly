# Project WAVERLY

![project WAVERLY](static/images/favicon.png)


## Overview
Project WAVERLY is a web application, that uses text-to-speech technology provided by [Amazon Polly](https://aws.amazon.com/polly/) to allow users to save textual articles and to convert them into an audio snippet (similar to a short podcast episode) that sounds human-like.

WAVERLY supports only English articles.

## WAVERLY is live üôå
Go to [https://waverly1.herokuapp.com/](https://waverly1.herokuapp.com/) and see how it works.

## Standalone Web Application
WAVERLY works beautifully as a standalone web application. Just go the [WAVERLY URL](https://waverly1.herokuapp.com/) on your mobile device, go to your account page, and save the URL to your home screen.  
This was tested only on iPhone's Safari.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Because of an [iOS's limited support for HTML5](http://debuggerdotbreak.judahgabriel.com/2016/12/13/its-almost-2017-and-html5-audio-is-still-broken-on-ios/), when triggering WAVERLY from the home screen, playing an audio file won't work while the app is in the background won't work. For this reason, the recommendation to the user to save the app to the home screen has been commented in the JS code.</br><img src="static/images/homescreen.png" width="240"/>
